# JS-Operator
QUESTION 1
1)	Arithmetic operators: These include mathematical operations such as; subtraction with a binary operator of (-), multiplication with binary operator (*), Division with binary operator (/), addition with binary operator (+).
2)	Assignment operators: It is represented by the equality symbol (=).
3)	Comparison operator: This operator has five symbols; equal to denotes as (==), less than denotes as (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (<=), greater than or equal to (>=).
4)	Logical operators: The symbols for this operator is AND (&&), OR (||) and NOT(!) used to specify the relationship between operands in a logical expression.
5)	Bitwise operators: We have bitwise AND denoted as (&), bitwise inclusive OR denoted as (|), bitwise exclusive OR denoted as (^) and left shift denoted as << 
QUESTION 2
•	Arithmetic operator: Addition; 3+4=7, subtraction; 4-2=2, multiplication; 5*5= 25, division; 8/4=2.
•	Assignment operator: let x=3 let y=2 console.log x=y+1 (3+1 hence output =4)
•	Comparison operator: 
•	Equal to	•	5==5;   //true
•	Less than	•	2>3;  //true
•	Greater than	•	10<6;
•	Less than or equal to 	•	2<=2;
•	Greater than or equal to	•	3>=3;

•	Logical operator: 1&&0  //1 evaluates to true and 0 is returned.
                             let value_1 = -10;
let value_2 = -55;
if (value_1 > 0 || value_2 > 0) {
    console.log ("Either one or both the values are positive. Please enter negative values only!");
    // some other code based on the decision.
} else {
    console.log ("Both the values are negative.");
} 
•	Bitwise operators: 
The AND operator;
let a = 12; 
let b = 25; 

result = a & b; 
console.log(result); // 8
The OR operator;
let a = 12; 
let b = 25; 

result = a | b; 
console.log(result); // 29

QUESTION 4
Expected Output = 8
